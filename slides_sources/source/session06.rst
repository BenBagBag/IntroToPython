Notes from Homework:
--------------------

Comparing to "singletons":

Use:

``if something is None``

Not:

``if something == None``

(also ``True`` and ``False``)

rich comparisons: numpy

(demo)

.. nextslide::

Binary mode for files:

.. code-block:: python

    infile = open(infilename, 'rb')
    outfile = open(outfilename, 'wb')

|
|

You don't actually need to use the result of a list comp:

.. code-block:: python

    for i, st in zip( divisors, sets):
        [ st.add(j) for j in range(21) if not j%i ]

=========================
Advanced Argument Passing
=========================

This is a very, very nift Python feature -- it really lets you write dynamic programs.

Keyword arguments
-----------------

When defining a function, you can specify only what you need -- in any order

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [151]: def fun(x=0, y=0, z=0):
            print(x,y,z)
       .....:
    In [152]: fun(1,2,3)
    1 2 3
    In [153]: fun(1, z=3)
    1 0 3
    In [154]: fun(z=3, y=2)
    0 2 3


.. nextslide::


A Common Idiom:

.. code-block:: python

    def fun(x, y=None):
        if y is None:
            do_something_different
        go_on_here


.. nextslide::

Can set defaults to variables

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [156]: y = 4
    In [157]: def fun(x=y):
        print("x is:", x)
       .....:
    In [158]: fun()
    x is: 4


.. nextslide::

Defaults are evaluated when the function is defined

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [156]: y = 4
    In [157]: def fun(x=y):
        print("x is:", x)
       .....:
    In [158]: fun()
    x is: 4
    In [159]: y = 6
    In [160]: fun()
    x is: 4

This is a **very** important point -- I will repeat it!


Function arguments in variables
-------------------------------

function arguments are really just

* a tuple (positional arguments)
* a dict (keyword arguments)

.. code-block:: python

    def f(x, y, w=0, h=0):
        print("position: {}, {} -- shape: {}, {}".format(x, y, w, h))

    position = (3,4)
    size = {'h': 10, 'w': 20}

    >>> f(*position, **size)
    position: 3, 4 -- shape: 20, 10


Function parameters in variables
--------------------------------

You can also pull the parameters out in the function as a tuple and a dict:

.. code-block:: ipython

    def f(*args, **kwargs):
        print("the positional arguments are:", args)
        print("the keyword arguments are:", kwargs)

    In [389]: f(2, 3, this=5, that=7)
    the positional arguments are: (2, 3)
    the keyword arguments are: {'this': 5, 'that': 7}

This can be very powerful...

Passing a dict to str.format()
-------------------------------

Now that you know that keyword args are really a dict,
you know how this nifty trick works:

The string ``format()`` method takes keyword arguments:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [24]: "My name is {first} {last}".format(last="Barker", first="Chris")
    Out[24]: 'My name is Chris Barker'

Build a dict of the keys and values:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [25]: d = {"last":"Barker", "first":"Chris"}

And pass to ``format()``with ``**``

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [26]: "My name is {first} {last}".format(**d)
    Out[26]: 'My name is Chris Barker'

LAB
----

.. rst-class:: medium

  keyword arguments:

* Write a function that has four optional parameters (with defaults):

  - fore_color
  - back_color
  - link_color
  - visited_color

* Have it print the colors (use strings for the colors)
* Call it with a couple different parameters set
* Have it pull the parameters out with ``*args, **kwargs``
  - and print those

=====================================
A bit more on mutability (and copies)
=====================================

mutable objects
----------------

We've talked about this: mutable objects can have their contents changed in place.

Immutable objects can not.

This has implications when you have a container with mutable objects in it:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [28]: list1 = [ [1,2,3], ['a','b'] ]

one way to make a copy of a list:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [29]: list2 = list1[:]

    In [30]: list2 is list1
    Out[30]: False

they are different lists.

.. nextslide::

What if we set an element to a new value?

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [31]: list1[0] = [5,6,7]

    In [32]: list1
    Out[32]: [[5, 6, 7], ['a', 'b']]

    In [33]: list2
    Out[33]: [[1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b']]

So they are independent.

.. nextslide::

But what if we mutate an element?

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [34]: list1[1].append('c')

    In [35]: list1
    Out[35]: [[5, 6, 7], ['a', 'b', 'c']]

    In [36]: list2
    Out[36]: [[1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']]

uuh oh! mutating an element in one list mutated the one in the other list.

.. nextslide::

Why is that?

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [38]: list1[1] is list2[1]
    Out[38]: True

The elements are the same object!

This is known as a "shallow" copy -- Python doesn't want to copy more than it needs to, so in this case, it makes a new list, but does not make copies of the contents.

Same for dicts (and any container type -- even tuples!)

If the elements are immutable, it doesn't really make a differnce -- but be very careful with mutable elements.


The copy module
----------------

most objects have a way to make copies (``dict.copy()`` for instance).

but if not, you can use the ``copy`` module to make a copy:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [39]: import copy

    In [40]: list3 = copy.copy(list2)

    In [41]: list3
    Out[41]: [[1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']]

This is also a shallow copy.

.. nextslide::

But there is another option:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [3]: list1
    Out[3]: [[1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']]

    In [4]: list2 = copy.deepcopy(list1)

    In [5]: list1[0].append(4)

    In [6]: list1
    Out[6]: [[1, 2, 3, 4], ['a', 'b', 'c']]

    In [7]: list2
    Out[7]: [[1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']]

``deepcopy`` recurses through the object, making copies of everything as it goes.

.. nextslide::


I happened on this thread on stack overflow:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3975376/understanding-dict-copy-shallow-or-deep

The OP is pretty confused -- can you sort it out?

Make sure you understand the difference between a reference, a shallow copy, and a deep copy.

Mutables as default arguments:
------------------------------

Another "gotcha" is using mutables as default arguments:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [11]: def fun(x, a=[]):
       ....:     a.append(x)
       ....:     print(a)
       ....:

This makes sense: maybe you'd pass in a specific list, but if not, the default is an empty list.

But:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [12]: fun(3)
    [3]

    In [13]: fun(4)
    [3, 4]

Huh?!

.. nextslide::

Remember that that default argument is defined when the function is created: there will be only one list, and every time the function is called, that same list is used.


The solution:

The standard practice for such a mutable default argument:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [15]: def fun(x, a=None):
       ....:     if a is None:
       ....:         a = []
       ....:     a.append(x)
       ....:     print(a)
    In [16]: fun(3)
    [3]
    In [17]: fun(4)
    [4]

You get a new list every time the function is called



===================
Anonymous functions
===================

lambda
------

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [171]: f = lambda x, y: x+y
    In [172]: f(2,3)
    Out[172]: 5

Content of function can only be an expression -- not a statement

Anyone remember what the difference is?

Called "Anonymous": it doesn't need a name.

.. nextslide::

It's a python object, it can be stored in a list or other container

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [7]: l = [lambda x, y: x+y]
    In [8]: type(l[0])
    Out[8]: function


And you can call it:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [9]: l[0](3,4)
    Out[9]: 7


Functions as first class objects
---------------------------------

You can do that with "regular" functions too:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [12]: def fun(x,y):
       ....:     return x+y
       ....:
    In [13]: l = [fun]
    In [14]: type(l[0])
    Out[14]: function
    In [15]: l[0](3,4)
    Out[15]: 7



======================
Functional Programming
======================

map
---

``map``  "maps" a function onto a sequence of objects -- It applies the function to each item in the list, returning another list


.. code-block:: ipython

    In [23]: l = [2, 5, 7, 12, 6, 4]
    In [24]: def fun(x):
                 return x*2 + 10
    In [25]: map(fun, l)
    Out[25]: [14, 20, 24, 34, 22, 18]


But if it's a small function, and you only need it once:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [26]: map(lambda x: x*2 + 10, l)
    Out[26]: [14, 20, 24, 34, 22, 18]


filter
------

``filter``  "filters" a sequence of objects with a boolean function --
It keeps only those for which the function is True

To get only the even numbers:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [27]: l = [2, 5, 7, 12, 6, 4]
    In [28]: filter(lambda x: not x%2, l)
    Out[28]: [2, 12, 6, 4]

If you pass ``None`` to ``filter()``, you get only items that evaluate to true:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: l = [1, 0, 2.3, 0.0, 'text', '', [1,2], [], False, True, None ]

    In [2]: filter(None, l)
    Out[2]: [1, 2.3, 'text', [1, 2], True]



reduce
------

``reduce``  "reduces" a sequence of objects to a single object with a function that combines two arguments

To get the sum:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [30]: l = [2, 5, 7, 12, 6, 4]
    In [31]: reduce(lambda x,y: x+y, l)
    Out[31]: 36


To get the product:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [32]: reduce(lambda x,y: x*y, l)
    Out[32]: 20160

or

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [13]: import operator

    In [14]: reduce(operator.mul, l)
    Out[14]: 20160

Comprehensions
--------------

Couldn't you do all this with comprehensions?

Yes:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [33]: [x+2 + 10 for x in l]
    Out[33]: [14, 17, 19, 24, 18, 16]

    In [34]: [x for x in l if not x%2]
    Out[34]: [2, 12, 6, 4]

    In [6]: l
    Out[6]: [1, 0, 2.3, 0.0, 'text', '', [1, 2], [], False, True, None]
    In [7]: [i for i in l if i]
    Out[7]: [1, 2.3, 'text', [1, 2], True]

(Except Reduce)

But Guido thinks almost all uses of reduce are really ``sum()``

Functional Programming
----------------------

Comprehensions and map, filter, reduce are all "functional programming" approaches}

``map, filter``  and ``reduce``  pre-date comprehensions in Python's history

Some people like that syntax better

And "map-reduce" is a big concept these days for parallel processing of "Big Data" in NoSQL databases.

(Hadoop, MongoDB, etc.)


A bit more about lambda
------------------------

Can also use keyword arguments

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [186]: l = []
    In [187]: for i in range(3):
        l.append(lambda x, e=i: x**e)
       .....:
    In [189]: for f in l:
        print(f(3))
    1
    3
    9

Note when the keyword argument is evaluated: this turns out to be very handy!

lambda and keyword argument magic
-----------------------------------

Write a function that returns a list of n functions,
such that each one, when called, will return the input value,
incremented by an increasing number.

Use a for loop, ``lambda``, and a keyword argument

( Extra credit ):

Do it with a list comprehension, instead of a for loop

Not clear? here's what you should get

.. nextslide:: Example calling code

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [96]: the_list = function_builder(4)
    ### so the_list should contain n functions (callables)
    In [97]: the_list[0](2)
    Out[97]: 2
    ## the zeroth element of the list is a function that add 0
    ## to the input, hence called with 2, returns 2
    In [98]: the_list[1](2)
    Out[98]: 3
    ## the 1st element of the list is a function that adds 1
    ## to the input value, thus called with 2, returns 3
    In [100]: for f in the_list:
        print(f(5))
       .....:
    5
    6
    7
    8
    ### If you loop through them all, and call them, each one adds one more
    to the input, 5... i.e. the nth function in the list adds n to the input.

Closures and function Currying

"Closures" and "Currying" are cool CS terms for what is really just defining functions on the fly.
